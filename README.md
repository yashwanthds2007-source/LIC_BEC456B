Experiment 01: Common Source (CS) Amplifier Design and Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the complete design, theoretical analysis, and LTspice simulation for a Common Source (CS) Amplifier. The experiment aims to design the amplifier within a specified power budget, verify its DC operating point, and evaluate its transient and AC responses.

Objectives
Design Validation: Calculate appropriate values for component parameters (like 
R
D
 and MOSFET width 
W
) to meet a specific power budget (
0.333
 mA
).
DC Analysis: Verify that the MOSFET operates in the saturation region.
Transient & AC Analysis: Determine the practical voltage gain and bandwidth (identifying the high cut-off frequency, 
f
H
) and compare them against theoretical calculations.
Repository Structure
EXP-01-CS-Amplifier.asc: The main LTspice schematic file containing the circuit design.
report.md: The comprehensive lab report detailing the mathematical verification, power budget calculations, gain validation, and comparison between theoretical and simulated results.
images/: A directory containing all necessary simulation screenshots, including the circuit diagram, DC operating point, VTC curve, transient response, and AC analysis graphs.
